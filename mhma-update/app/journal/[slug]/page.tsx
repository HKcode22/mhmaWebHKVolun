Discussed comments/suggestions from BODs, made edits to the document where needed. There are a couple of comments still open to be discussed in the next BOD meeting.

**MHMA Reinstatement Update**
The review of 1023 is in final state. Last step to clarify a question on Grants that were identified on the financial docs. Saqib following up with Tax consultant.

**MHMA Welcoming Summer Picnic (May 16)**
Combine MHMA Welcome Summer Picnic with other MHMA program – MHMA Day proposed by Hidaya Committee. We also discussed the other MHMA Picnic that happens in Sept/October where BBQ is done by Boy Scouts Troop and will continue that.

**Montessori Program**
Asad S noted that this program is out of compliance. There was no formal BOD approval for starting this program and there are no details provided for operational and governance purposes. We have to revisit this and do a formal review, ensure all documentation is in place and a shared understanding of the arrangements. Previous board meeting notes were shared, and it was noted that Education committee will discuss and come back with a proposal. Umar S had a different recollection where it was noted that an approval was obtained.

**Arafah Iftaar**
Agreed to have a structured community iftaar communication regarding this. Last time it was informal and not many people from community joined for iftaar.

**Eid Al Adha Planning**
Things to consider – Finals Weeks for MHHS; Graduation for Middle school and Weekday. Decision made to have petting zoo, face painting, jumpers, magic show etc. Lead to execute Eid end-end: Waqas.

**Robotics & Lego Competition**
Discussed that this will be scheduled 2nd week of May. Waqas to look at calendar availability and propose a date/time and coordinate the event.

**AI Trainings Request for UC**
Umar S & Mohamed are conducted AI trainings in a personal capacity and wanted to discuss using UC. Some proceeds from the program will be donated to MHMA. Did not discuss in detail as we did not have a quorum for this to make a decision.

**Al-Hayy request**
Update from Umar S → The UC availability for these times and dates is tentative as City is looking to book the UC during summer and as a result we are moving around our schedule for Maktab. We will know more closer to last week of May or early June but as of now consider it unavailable and plan accordingly.`,

Meeting calendar was published. Finalized board meeting schedule for full board as well as BODs. When needed we will discuss and arrange adhoc full board meeting based on discussion topics and urgency on decision making. We also agreed that we will take a poll on timing ahead of meetings to ensure the date and time works for majority.

**MHMA Reinstatement update**
Umar S Update: Things are moving forward. Were blocked a few actions from accounting firm. They have been very thorough – we have the info we need from them. 1023 has been completed and submitted to Barbara. Attorney(Barbara) has reviewed and shared updates. Core team has to review her updates and provide a response along with financials.

**Construction Next Steps & update**
Spoken to couple of folks to get leads on Architects, civil engineers; leaning towards Tauheed bhai (from Brentwood) to prepare and submit the package to city of MH. Hired woodrodgers for surveys. Target: 3-4 months (End of July) to have the package ready for submission to city. What is our concern with Tauheed? He is a GC, the conversations so far, has been he is proposing to change designs whereas we have all aligned on designs based on our community needs. He is opiniated but also has good suggestions.

**Sub-Division:** The paperwork for recording sub-division has been submitted to City. The city has submitted this to the county. The turnaround from County is 4 weeks – next update is end of April. Also exploring a firm from Chicago, suggested by Asif Alvi. Folsom is also using someone in Chicago. Decision to be made by end of this coming week – April 3rd.

**Action:** Provide an update on construction every Friday.

**Property Tax update**
Submitted the paperwork to appeal on their determination. They noted that they will not give us full 7 acre but more than the 2 acre they have already approved. Updates to the land – flatten out and plan to start parking there.

**Website needs to update with all MHMA programs, pictures, etc.**
Trying to get 4 containers – connected, fully finished with necessary HVAC. We will have to have permits from the City because containers will have occupancy. Once we have a sense of close-to-final pricing, we should explore next steps. Suggestion is to have the discussions with City on these temp classrooms along with the renewal discussion of UC.

**MHMA Committee Policy Follow up**
Agreed to have a separate dedicated meeting for BODs to discuss and finalize.

**UC booking management challenges**
City meetings conflicting with MHMA program (Maktab). Everyone should get access to mhma95391@gmail.com to view the most up to date calendar on events and programs that block UC. If there is a City placeholder and City blocks over MHMA program, Umar S will discuss and mediate with City to move if possible.

**MHMA Website (main source of info for community)**
Offline discussion with Br Kanishka.

**Two-day pre-school program (Sr Musarrat Proposal)**
Sr Musarat spoke to Oussama with a proposal for pre-school for ages 3-5 timing 9-11am or 9:30-11:30am. This program will be run under MHMA. Next Steps/Action: Discuss this part of education committee and come back with a proposal to BODs.

Cited personal reasons and commitments for resigning. BODs accepted resignation and thanked him for his services and sacrifices for community. BODs were presented with an option to pick from for the vacant position – Mohammad Waqas's name was shared by Faisal as a potential candidate.

**Property Tax Update**
Alhumdulillah we have the retroactive approval on the 2acres. They may either give us credit towards next bill or money back for the last 3 years of property tax. AJ drafted an email to send out to SJC Tax office. They may audit the location once the email goes out – we first must study the handbook, understand the requirements, make the necessary changes to our site and show that we are utilizing majority of the land. No rush to send email as we must align on what changes we will make to the land. Asad S suggested again that we Talk to attorneys and understand what they can do for us vs us analyzing/interpreting the handbooks ourselves in our own individual capacities. The board agreed to explore the attorney option.

Reviewed month-end Dec financials. Br Saqib provided a new view for expenses by category which was helpful to understand buckets (large and small). Asad S asked the q on why we do not pay Property Tax from Donation Account vs. Operations as the prop tax is a result of purchasing land for masjid and Jumma donations moved to Operations vs using for masjid. Pending decision on both but everyone on BOD agreed and we took an action. Reviewed Maktab expenses for Dec which resulted in discussion and review of Imam responsibilities for MHMA activities. Follow ups on these will be executed in subsequent Full Board meetings.

Asad S – We are 45days away and must form a team and identify lead. Umar bhai proposed br. Saqib to take the lead. We all agreed to support and help alongside volunteers. Asad S will lead all iftar setups & Faisal S is lead for Eid Mela.

**Ramadan Planning Lead –** Saqib
- Partner with MSA in HS
- Build a team with Sr Masarat to take care of kids
- Heaters – Test vendor came back and shared they made a mistake in initial quote and only included 1 week of heater costs($300) vs 4 weeks($1200). We agreed we do not need heater from vendor. Umar S suggested that should avoid using the propane heaters. Buy the heaters with hot air and we have one already that we have used before.

Br Oussama provided an update that he Canceled Human Appeal presence this Ramadan as we did not get Shk Jibreel.

**FCNA**
Mohamed – Aligning MHMA to FCNA. Will help with overall guidance on religious rulings/questions. Ex: Ramadan. Umar S – Currently MHMA is aligned with Hilal Committee of NA. How does this shift our approach and which madhab we follow? There are Pros and Cons. We should outline the purpose, benefits and Pros/Cons to be able to make a decision.

**Family Nights/Events/UC Bookings**
**Family Nights Plan(Br Mohamed)** – Schedule it for every 3rd Sat of the month. At times we will have to cancel (ex: Ramdan). Our 1st FN for 2026 will be Jan 17th. Two speakers lined up with topics – Halal Financing; Special Needs. Bringing on Br Asim Khan onboard to help MC FNs.

**Events Committee**
Revisit the event committee to coordinate all MHMA events across all programs. Centralize coordination, bookings and logistics.

**UC Bookings** has been an issue for many as to visibility. Umar S – Everyone should already have access to the MHMA calendar to view scheduled events and times. Also here they can view what slots are open for scheduling new events. This cal is already on Google. The new BOD/BOTs will be given access.

**Policies finalization and adoption**
What is the process of Creating, Reviewing and Approving policies? Once policy is circulated, we should give 3 weeks for everyone to review, provide comments, feedback and discuss comments. We should then pass a resolution to adopt or not. Once the policy is adopted only then it is enforced.

**MHMA Committees Updates**
Asad S shared the committee cadence calendar with the board. We have 14 committees currently and if we have each committee present once a qtr we will have to have an agenda topic by Committee on every weekly BOD meeting. BOD agrees to follow this cadence once the following is complete: All committees should have properly defined Purpose and Objectives, Targets and team structure.

**Action Items:**
- Review bylaws on how funds should be allocated/disbursed – Jumma donations, property taxes payouts – Who are the decision makers BODs or BOTs or combination @Umar @Asad
- Br Saqib to kick off Ramadan Planning
- Share heater(blowers) links with Asad to review and make purchases @Umar S
- Outline the purpose of aligning with FCNA – @Mohamed Mohamed
- Share access to the mhma95391 calendar with all Board members to review conflicts with CU availability as well as overlapping programs @Umar S
- Share the MHMA Committee Governance Policy with everyone to comment @Umar Sear
- Decision on Maktab be part of Education Committee – @Umar @Mohamed @Oussama
- Asad S to follow up with each MHMA committee to ensure we action the BOD recommended steps before we kick off Committee cadence`,

    content: `The MHMA board meeting was held on 21-Dec-25. The following meeting minutes were recorded:

**MINUTES**

**Agenda 12/21 Full Board Meeting**

**Construction Update**
Wood Rodgers(Civil engineers) came back with an ask of $15K to finish the sub-division update – Final Map approval for sub-division to be fully approved (conditions still apply – Construction of the Providence Rd completed within 3 years). We will be getting a 2nd opinion on that. We will have more update next Tuesday. We need help on conducting surveys that is where Wood Rodgers will come in handy, but we believe the city should have all these surveys and we would be able to avoid this. Earlier we received an invoice of $15K, majority of the scope of work from this invoice has been completed.

3 Year condition – if everything is done within 3 years. Those conditions expire and the city can impose additional conditions after. Alignment with QV has yet to happen. Suggestion: Invite Sandhu, do an event with him.

3D plan – Planning to present the 3D plan to the community. BOT suggestion was to conduct small group meetings with community and suggestion is to encourage within this for community members to increase membership donations to $100. Start with our large donors first. Discussion with Board and guidance to BOTs that we should not bring up memberships in these conversations and keep the discussion specifically to 3D plan, get feedback and encourage for donations.

**Property Tax Update & execution RACI**
AJ provided an update from his meeting with county officers. Shared about BOE, what MHMA can do a church. Spoke to supervisor of the BOE. Documented all notes and contact info. She provided a lot of new info. We have to convince her that we operate and our use of land is exactly as a church and that we are using the land for religious purposes. Out of 5 acres, we have an approval for 2 acres retroactively (verbally not in writing). We have to provide evidence for rest of 3 acres usage. Everything that we have done for last 2 years on the land – we should upload on website and collect centrally as evidence. Our mission statement should comply with religious activity/organization operations. We have to email the supervisor and get the process started to review the remaining land that is not exempt. Deadline is Jan 1st for retroactively update tax status.

Asad S created a RACI for execution as this framework will help in identifying roles & responsibilities in-line with bylaws and speed up execution and assistance needed with right people identified and accountable – we did not get a chance to review the RACI and will be discussing offline to finalize. Suggestion from Asad S to pursue Attorneys that specifically have expertise in BOE and property tax exemption. With expert guidance we will not only move in the right direction but also expedite the process.

**MHMA non-profit update**
We have been working with the Attorney on reinstatement process and overall guidance on structure. Completed the 1023 form for reinstatement but not filed. Attorney has noted that the non-profit explorer site has evidence that we have submitted tax return to IRS for 2023. Tax return FY 2022 not filed yet. Will continue to receive guidance from attorney on this. Currently MHMA has no intent to shift assets to a Waqf/estate plan with so much going on. We will, at a time agreed upon by board, will initiate a conversation again to establish this with guidance from a estate plan attorney.

**Structure of Religious Committee, Criteria & Voting to change**
Goal is to have all committees as inclusive and transparent as possible. Same applies to the religious committee. Observation is that current religious committee is specific to a region and suggestion from Oussama is to have it inclusive and diverse while also clarifying the criteria, qualification and enrollment of existing and new committee members. BOTs have an agenda item in the next meeting. Suggestion to discuss Religious Committee composition/structure of the committee. In connection to this agenda Umar S shared a draft policy.

**Ramadan prep & key decisions**
Asad S presented Ramadan Iftar setup options to the Board. Options included School, Tent & Containers. Recommendation is for Tents as it will be convenient for volunteers, women, food & taraweeh logistics. Total costs for tents are $4k or less in addition to heaters if we decide to add heaters. Board decision – Move forward finalizing the tent vendor for Ramadan. There was a suggestion from Sarfaraz to keep School as a plan B and if bookings can be canceled in a relatively short time-period we should have bookings in place. Suggestion from Umar S to organize Eid Mela on UC land, extending what we already do to be more elaborate and additional fun elements for kids and families. @faisal Shahid taking lead on this.

**MINUTES**

**Location:** Unit Center

**Agenda**

**Review Operational Expenses (including Maktab)**
BODs reviewed monthly operational expenses – walkthrough by Saqib M. The file with all details to the expenses is shared with all BODs. We also deep dived into Maktab as a program and its expenses. Overall Maktab is net positive now.

**Balady FR**
UC booked for 4 hrs on Dec 21st. Can provide a receipt at the end of the event for the sum collected if requested – do we need this? NO. A tax deduction receipt can be provided. Ask: Create a flyer with MHMA logo/template to show collaboration with Balady – We don't need to do this. Balady can have their own flyer.

**Decision:** No need to create flyer. MHMA approves them to conduct a FR under their own banner, they can use UC for the time already allocated.

**Ramadan Preparation Update and Human Appeal update / IMRC**
**Ramadan Iftar Arrangements**
Asad S gave an update at the BOD meeting today and had a follow up meeting with the vendor. In summary, our first preference was installing tents at UC so we continue to have iftars at our facility vs schools which would have been inefficient for many. I believe we have a great local option with good quality tents, the necessary equipment to secure them, keep them heated and an option to install/take-down over the weekends which will not require any city permits.

**Details**
Coordinated a meeting with the local vendor to visit Unity Center today and provide us a more accurate quote. Saqib bhai and I met with them. They took measurements of the space and we have decided to install 4 tents of 40×20 to cover the UC parking lot. We got an initial quote from the vendor for $4000 for 4 tents for 4 weeks with an additional day for the last week. Negotiated this to $3600. This includes installation every Friday and taking it down Sunday morning. For the last week (March 14th weekend) since we have khatam, we want the tent to be taken down on Monday instead of Sunday. We also asked for heaters and they provide the gas heaters for indoor-tent use for $50/heater. Saqib and Asad S agreed that we should just rent it from the vendor as they will be responsible for their tents instead of us adding our heaters later.

**Recommendation –** Move forward and finalize this vendor after sharing with Full Board on 12/21.

**Ask is for 27th** Decision: If Shk Jibreel is not available then we do not need to allow it.

**IMRC:** Have them come over upcoming jumma and setup a table.

**Agenda Topics Not Covered**
- Board Process for assigning responsibilities
- Family Nights/Events
- MHMA Committees Review

**Action Items:**
- Combine Income and expenses by program for visibility of Board @Saqib
- Any new activity/program requests that community members have(ask for), they should share the request with the Board to be evaluated. If they reach out to BOD/BOTs, we can direct them to send email request @All BODs
- We must create a backlog of new program/activity requests @Asad S
- Determine how many members vs non-members are registered in Maktab. How many of the registered are residents of MH vs outside @Umar S
- Discuss with Maktab team to reduce Maktab to 3 days a week to free up one additional day other than Friday for other MHMA activities. Suggestion is Thursday @Umar S

Note: Financial numbers will be updated once a month. The Month-ending Nov 2025 have already been published in the previous BOD meeting minutes. The next will be in Jan to cover Month-ending Dec 2025`,

**Agenda**

**Financial Update**
Decision: We will start with financial update every 1st week of the new month so it covers the prior month-closing

**Ramadan Operational Preparation**
Discussed establishing a Ramadan Committee. It should be their mandate to plan and execute the Ramadan operations.
The process of establishing committee may slow down planning, implementing/executing many tasks.
We should not pause any progress and decisions BOD must make. In parallel we could establish a committee and have them execute decisions. We encourage committee coming up with new process and ideas and they should evaluate and suggest to BOD
There is also a proposal to establish committee but make it effective from next year

**Decisions to be made immediately**
- Iftar Setup & How many Iftars
- Options
- Suggestion to do Iftar in schools. Prefer HS. Cordes & Hansen has the biggest MPR. One for Women & Men. HS first preference, then we should pursue Cordes/Hansen
- Large Enclosed Tents with heaters
- Container
- Who will lead Taraweeh – Sh Ammar is available only until the 25th night of Ramadan and wants to fly back to celebrate eid with his family. Discussed this topic boradly with BOTs as well and we will confirm Shk Ammar to join. Khatam Quran will be decided as soon as we start Ramadan

**Compliance to Bylaws**
Revisit and review existing core committees, their committee members, charters, objectives and re-align if necessary
Understanding of bylaws and executing in compliance of these is important for every BOD.

**Improving BOD alignment, communication & responsibility clarity**
BOD responsibilities. Named roles leading specific programs/projects.
Come up with an approach to assign project/programs to BOD members and reasoning on why vs being selective and having offline conversations where work is discussed/assigned. Frequent updates on progress per BOD/role

**MHMA Committees & Announcements**
As a BOD we must revisit all committees, their structure, mandate, committee composition and create a frequent cadence for them to come present progress at BOD
Communication to community (with the caveat/option that we will evolve) officially needs to happen within six weeks of coming into office of a new Board of Directors
Concerns raised on structure of Hidaya Committee. Representing single school of thought. more discussion to happen on this in next meeting with the right attendees

**Action Items**

    content: `The MHMA board meeting was held on24-Nov-25. The following meeting minutes were recorded:

**MINUTES**

**Location:** Unit Center

**Agenda & Minutes**

**Operating Principles – Brown Act and Rosenberg Rules**
Brown Act: applicable to public governing bodies only – helps in decision making, transparency of decision to the public. It requires us to be conducting our meetings in public, deliberations in public (how a board member votes on decisions etc. is publicly done). We could deliberate in private (in Board meetings) but share decisions publicly.
Rosenberg Rules: How deliberations and meetings are conducted. City Council example – the way meetings are conducted, how motions are handled, etc.
Suggestion:
Review these from an Islamic lens and understand what is applicable and can be adopted.
Applicability on non-profits vs government bodies. Our structure and governance are mainly driven by bylaws. We will have to look at what we can adopt to help streamline and be efficient vs follow these as-is

**Board Operations**
**BOD vs BOT Operating Model**
BOD & BOT Meeting
Both these bodies must have separate meetings with BODs meeting at-least once a month (per bylaws) and meet as full Board at a set cadence
Opinion is that MHMA has much to do so expecting BODs to have more regular meetings
BOT will decide what their frequency of meetings
BOT Chair
Shahzad Ali is the BOT chair. All BOTs voted unanimously for Shahzad to be elected for a term of 1 year

**Overlapping Projects**
Projects (in this case): A project that needs only board oversight and decision making to execute (would not have external community members involved). Ex: MHMA Non-profit Status
Construction of Masjid, Maktab, Hidaya are all programs or projects executed through committees. Committees must have a cadence to update progress to the BODs

**BOT <> BOD transitions**
We agreed that there are no projects/programs that need a formal transition to the BOD or vice versa

**Sanctity of the Board**
Discipline around motions/decisions etc similar to what we discussed on brown act and Rosenburg rules

**MHMA Non-Profit Org Status updates, owners & next steps**
**Non-Profit Reinstatement**
Barbara Rhomberg is hired officially to help with reinstatement
Filing form 1023 – In progress

**Tax Preparation**
Engaging with Tax Path to help with go forward tax preparation and filing. Once the reinstatement is completed. Tax Path will be hired
Also spoke to United Tax (Abbas) – they can help as an advisor

**Masjid Update – sub-division, design update (Moved to next meeting)**
We did not get the time to cover this topic in detail as the main agenda topic

**MHMA Committees**
Two types of committees – Statutory and non-statutory. Statutory committees must exist as per bylaws. Committees are advisory bodies. The decision-making power resides with the BODs
All committees report back to BODs except the construction and religion that report to BOTs
Purpose, goals, outcomes/success should be defined upfront.

**Finance Update**
Provided the update at the previous Nov meeting.
Updated Qard-e-Hasana numbers: $40,000 outstanding
Full Board Pledge ceremony took place in the Open Public Session

"I pledge to serve the Mountain House Muslim community sincerely, following the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah to the best of my ability.I will support and protect the mission, goals, and bylaws of the Mountain House Muslim Association. I will serve without fear, favor, or discrimination, and act with honesty, fairness, and integrity. I will avoid conflicts of interest, preserve the trust and property of the community, and fulfill my duties with transparency and accountability. I will work collaboratively for the unity, welfare, and success of our community.I make this commitment for the sake of Allah, seeking His guidance and His pleasure alone. Ameen."`,

Shared with community details of Account balance (Operations, Masjid Donations, and Qard). Provided an update on expenses and membership count  

**Open Q&A** 
**Suggestions from Community**: 

Multiple community members emphasized on responsibility. Some noted that if the bylaws note "oversee" then it creates ambiguity and there should be someone that should be responsible for directly leading and be accountable 
Workshops to educate community members about the by-laws. this would help increase engagement and ensure everyone has a clear understanding of our rules and processes and will avoid many back and forth questions 
To keep MHMA as non-profit, keep it compliant and avail benefits of being a non-religious (not as church)  
Get feedback from community on events and programs being conducted. Let's have a formal feedback process and share results consistently. Community will know that feedback is being considered, and improvements are happening 
Have events lead by the youth. Instead of the adults give opportunity to youth to lead activities. Recognize youths formally and have a practice to do this frequently 
Transparency and follow-up on the process of committee selection and closing the loop with members who apply  
A team dedicated to responding to emails from community in a timely manner  
Establish a women's committee 
Use of OKRs  
*not all suggestions are included. we have requested some members to send suggestions via email as they had some great detail included.

    attendees: "",
    content: `This weekend at MHMA was a perfect reflection of what makes our community strong — dedication, teamwork, and shared values. In just two days, we witnessed two outstanding events: a meaningful Hajj Workshop and an engaging Lego competition. Both reminded us how powerful it is when we come together to learn, grow, and support one another.

**A Spiritual Journey: The Hajj Workshop**
On Saturday, Sister Khadeja led a deeply impactful Hajj Workshop. Her clarity, care, and depth of knowledge made the session an inspiring experience for attendees of all ages. She walked us through the meaning and steps of Hajj with a perfect blend of information and reflection.

This workshop wasn't just about learning — it was about connecting with our faith. Through her leadership, Sister Khadeja helped participants understand the spiritual purpose behind each step of the pilgrimage. It was an experience that left a lasting impression on everyone present.

**Learning Through Play: The Lego Competition**
On Sunday, the community gathered again for a different kind of event — the Lego competition, led and organized by Muhammad Waqas. This event focused on structured model-building, where children followed standard designs to complete their projects.

While creativity wasn't the focus, the event was still full of valuable moments. The kids showed focus, patience, and teamwork. They supported each other, followed instructions carefully, and completed their models with pride. It was a joy to see so many young faces fully engaged, learning to follow guidelines while having fun in a positive, social setting.

Thanks to Muhammad Waqas's thoughtful planning and calm leadership, the competition was well-run and enjoyable for all.

**Volunteers: The Silent Engines Behind Every Event**
At the heart of both events — and every event at MHMA — are our incredible volunteers. These individuals consistently give their time, energy, and effort to serve the community, often without recognition. They take on tasks large and small, always with dedication and care.

Their behind-the-scenes work is what makes everything possible. From setting up venues to managing logistics, greeting guests to cleaning up afterward — they do it all. And they do it with heart. We are endlessly grateful for their contribution.

**Members: The Backbone of MHMA**
We also want to sincerely thank our MHMA members. Your support through membership fees is what sustains this organization and allows us to host events like these — not just occasionally, but dozens of times every month.

Your commitment to MHMA helps us provide consistent, high-quality programming for people of all ages. It allows us to plan, grow, and serve. By maintaining your membership, you're not just helping the organization run — you're investing in the future of this community.

**The Children: Our Shared Joy**
And of course, a special thanks to the children who participated in the Lego competition. You brought focus, fun, and friendliness to the event. Your patience, willingness to follow the rules, and kind attitude toward each other made the day a success.

Your smiles are the reason we work so hard to organize these events. Seeing you enjoy, learn, and grow — that's the greatest reward for all of us.

**Looking Ahead**
This weekend was a wonderful snapshot of what MHMA does all year round. With dozens of activities each month, there is always something happening — something to learn, something to celebrate, and someone to connect with.

To Sister Khadeja, Muhammad Waqas, every volunteer, every member, and every participant: thank you. You are what makes MHMA not just an organization, but a true community.

Let's keep the momentum going — together.`,
